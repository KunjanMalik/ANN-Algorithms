# ANN-Algorithms: Applied below ANN algorithms:
**LSH** : Locality-sensitive hashing based algorithms are one of the most common strategies when it comes to ANN. They construct a hash table as their data structure by mapping points that are nearby into the same bucket. I am going to show how to use faiss, to do “Approximate Nearest Neighbors Using LSH”.

**Exhaustive Search** : Comparing each point to every other point, which will require Linear query time (the size of the dataset).

**Product Quantization** : Product quantization is an effective vector quantization approach to compactly encode high-dimensional vectors for fast approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search.

**Trees and Graphs** : Each tree is constructed in the following way, we pick two points at random and split the space into two by their hyperplane into subspaces.

**HSNW** : Hierarchical Navigable Small World Algorithm (HNSW) The HNSW graph algorithm is a fast and accurate solution to the approximate k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) search problem.
